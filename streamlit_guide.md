# How to Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

Your code is on GitHub, so deploying is very easy!

1.  **Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)** and sign up/login with your GitHub account.
2.  Click **"New app"**.
3.  **Repository**: Select `z7pvp4wp7m-del/football-betting-model`.
4.  **Branch**: `main`.
5.  **Main file path**: `app.py`.
6.  Click **"Deploy!"**.

## That's it!
Streamlit will take a minute to install the libraries (`requirements.txt`) and then your app will be live on the internet. You can share the link with anyone.
